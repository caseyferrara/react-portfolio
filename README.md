# React Portfolio for Casey Ferrara

A portfolio I made for myself using React. It contains my skillset, projects, and contact information. The contact form uses EmailJS to send emails directly to my inbox.

# NPM Components used for this project

## [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)

EmailJS helps sending emails using client side technologies only. No server is required – just connect EmailJS to one of the supported email services, create an email template, and use our Javascript library to trigger an email.

## [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

## [React Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)

Component for animating vertical scrolling.

## [React Simple Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@icons-pack/react-simple-icons)

This package provides the Simple Icons 3.12.3 packaged as a set of React components
